/*
** Explanation of the JavaScript Conditional Statements **

- **Variables Declaration**
  - Two variables are declared and initialized:
    - `let a = 10;`  // Variable `a` is assigned the value 10.
    - `let b = 20;`  // Variable `b` is assigned the value 20.

- **Conditional Statements**
  - The code uses an `if...else if...else` structure to compare the values of `a` and `b`.

  - **First Condition: `if (a > b)`**
    - This checks if `a` is greater than `b`.
    - If true, it executes the block:
      - `console.log("a is greater than b.");`
  
  - **Second Condition: `else if (a < b)`**
    - This checks if `a` is less than `b`.
    - If true, it executes the block:
      - `console.log("a is less than b.");`
  
  - **Final Condition: `else`**
    - This block executes if neither of the previous conditions are true, meaning `a` must be equal to `b`.
    - It executes the block:
      - `console.log("a is equal to b.");`

- **Execution Flow**
  - In this specific case:
    - Since `10` (value of `a`) is less than `20` (value of `b`), the output will be:
      - `a is less than b.`

- **Conclusion**
  - This code snippet effectively demonstrates how to use conditional statements in JavaScript to compare two values and execute different code blocks based on the comparison results.
