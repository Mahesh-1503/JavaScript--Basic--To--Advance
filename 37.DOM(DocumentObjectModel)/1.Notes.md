## WHAT IS DOM ?

## When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

## The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
