## Every javascript object has a anonymous property called prototype, Remember function & array are also a object, that prototype will be the parent of that object, prototype property is object by itself, which have some special properties & methods

## In JavaScript Every object is associated with another object.The object (a) is associated with [[ProtoType]] Object ----> which means obj object will inherit all properties of Object.prototype || [[Prototype]]

## we can check the prototype of something in 3 ways:
# ===> obj.__proto__
# ===> obj.constructor.prototype
# ===> Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) --> this is the most recommended way to get the prototype of an object
