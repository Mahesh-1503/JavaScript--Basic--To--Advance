<!-- ## In JavaScript Every object is associated with another object.The object (a) is associated with [[ProtoType]] Object
==> which means obj object will inherit all properties of Object.prototype || [[Prototype]]  -->

<!-- we can check the prototype of something in 3 ways:
===> obj.__proto__
===> obj.constructor.prototype
===> Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) -->
