<!-- Explanation of Polymorphism in This Code:
Parent Class (Parent):

The Parent class defines a method called getMobile, which logs 'iPhone 11' to the console.

This method represents a behavior or functionality that the Parent class provides.

Child Class (Child):

The Child class extends the Parent class using the extends keyword, inheriting all properties and methods from the Parent class.

The Child class overrides the getMobile method to provide its own implementation. Instead of logging 'iPhone 11', it logs 'iPhone 15'.

Polymorphism:

Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors depending on their class.

In this example, the getMobile method behaves differently depending on whether it is called on an instance of the Parent class or the Child class.

When getMobile is called on parentObj (an instance of Parent), it executes the Parent class's implementation and logs 'iPhone 11'.

When getMobile is called on childObj (an instance of Child), it executes the Child class's overridden implementation and logs 'iPhone 15'.

Key Points of Polymorphism:

Method Overriding: The Child class overrides the getMobile method to provide a specific implementation. This is a key feature of polymorphism.

Same Method, Different Behavior: The getMobile method behaves differently depending on the object's class, even though the method name is the same.

Flexibility: Polymorphism allows for flexible and extensible code. You can add new classes (e.g., GrandChild) with their own implementations of getMobile without modifying the existing code.

Summary:
Polymorphism is demonstrated in this code through method overriding.

The Child class overrides the getMobile method inherited from the Parent class to provide its own implementation.

When the getMobile method is called, it behaves differently depending on whether it is called on an instance of the Parent class or the Child class.

This allows for flexible and reusable code, where different classes can provide their own implementations of the same method. -->
