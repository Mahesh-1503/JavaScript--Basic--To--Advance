# Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** is the concept of bundling **data (properties)** and **methods (functions)** together within an object. This allows the object to control access to its internal data and behavior while exposing only the necessary interfaces to interact with the object.

In simpler terms, encapsulation is about **hiding the internal details** of how an object works and only allowing controlled access to its functionality. This helps in protecting the object's data from unintended interference and misuse.

### How Encapsulation Works in JavaScript:

In JavaScript, encapsulation can be achieved in several ways:

1. **Closures**: 
   - By using closures, you can create private variables and methods that are only accessible within a specific function or object.
   
2. **Symbols**:
   - Symbols can be used as property keys to create "hidden" properties that are not easily accessible from outside the object.

3. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Although JavaScript doesn't have built-in private members (prior to ES6), developers often use naming conventions like prefixing property names with an underscore (`_`) to indicate that they should be treated as private.

4. **Private Fields (ES6+)**:
   - With the introduction of ES6 classes, JavaScript now supports **private fields** using the `#` symbol. These fields can only be accessed within the class itself, providing true encapsulation.

### Benefits of Encapsulation:
- **Data Protection**: Prevents external code from directly modifying the internal state of an object.
- **Controlled Access**: Only expose what is necessary, making the code easier to maintain and less prone to errors.
- **Modularity**: Encapsulation promotes modular design, where each object is responsible for its own behavior and data.

By encapsulating data and methods, you ensure that the internal workings of an object remain hidden, and only the intended interfaces are exposed for interaction.
