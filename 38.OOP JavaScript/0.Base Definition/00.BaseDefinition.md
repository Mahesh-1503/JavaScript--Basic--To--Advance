OOP ?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming language model/style organized
around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic.

JavaScript is a versatile and dynamic programming language that
supports multiple paradigms, including procedural, functional, and
object-oriented programming. While JavaScript is not a purely object-oriented
language like java or C++, it provides the tools and features to 
implement OOP concepts effectively
