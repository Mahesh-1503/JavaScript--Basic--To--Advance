Factory Functions in JavaScript
A factory function is a function that creates and returns objects. Unlike classes or constructors, factory functions do not require the use of the new keyword. They are a flexible way to generate objects, especially when you need to add behavior or encapsulate object creation logic.

Why Use Factory Functions?
Encapsulation: They can hide internal logic or properties.
Reuse: You can reuse the function to create multiple similar objects.
Flexibility: You can customize the object creation process based on parameters.
Composition: They align well with composition over inheritance principles.


Syntax of a Factory Function:

function createObject(params) {
  return {
    property1: params.value1,
    property2: params.value2,
    method1() {
      console.log("Method logic here");
    }
  };
}
