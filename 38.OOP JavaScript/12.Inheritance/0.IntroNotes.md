# Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in **object-oriented programming (OOP)** where a **class** acquires the properties (attributes and methods) of another class. 

### Key Concepts:
1. **Parent Class (Superclass)**:
   - The class whose properties are inherited by another class.
   - Also known as the **base class** or **superclass**.

2. **Child Class (Subclass)**:
   - The class that inherits the properties from the parent class.
   - Also known as the **derived class** or **subclass**.

3. **Reusability**:
   - Inheritance promotes code reusability by allowing the child class to reuse the properties and methods of the parent class without rewriting them.

4. **Extensibility**:
   - The child class can extend or modify the behavior of the parent class by adding new properties or methods or overriding existing ones.

### Example:
```javascript
// Parent Class (Superclass)
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
    }
}

// Child Class (Subclass)
class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(name, breed) {
        super(name); // Call the parent class constructor
        this.breed = breed;
    }
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} barks.`); // Override the speak method
    }
}

// Create an instance of the Dog class
let dog = new Dog('Buddy', 'Golden Retriever');
dog.speak(); // Output: Buddy barks.
