<!-- Explanation of Inheritance in This Code:
Parent Class (Parent):

The Parent class defines a method called getMobile, which logs 'iPhone 11' to the console.

This method represents a behavior or functionality that the Parent class provides.

Child Class (Child):

The Child class is defined using the extends keyword, which means it inherits from the Parent class.

The Child class does not define any additional methods or properties. It simply inherits everything from the Parent class.

Inheritance Mechanism:

When the Child class extends the Parent class, it automatically gains access to all the methods and properties of the Parent class.

In this case, the Child class inherits the getMobile method from the Parent class.

Creating an Instance of Child:

An instance of the Child class is created using let obj = new Child();.

Even though the Child class does not explicitly define the getMobile method, it can still use it because it is inherited from the Parent class.

Calling the Inherited Method:

The getMobile method is called on the obj instance (obj.getMobile()).

Since the Child class inherits this method from the Parent class, the output is 'iPhone 11'.

Key Points of Inheritance in This Code:
Reusability: The Child class reuses the getMobile method from the Parent class without having to redefine it.

Code Organization: Inheritance helps organize code by creating a logical hierarchy of classes. The Child class can focus on additional or specific behaviors without duplicating code from the Parent class.

Extensibility: The Child class can extend the functionality of the Parent class by adding new methods or overriding existing ones (though overriding is not shown in this example).

Summary:
Inheritance allows the Child class to acquire the properties and methods of the Parent class.

In this example, the Child class inherits the getMobile method from the Parent class, demonstrating how inheritance promotes code reusability and logical organization.

The Child class can use the inherited method (getMobile) as if it were defined within itself. -->
