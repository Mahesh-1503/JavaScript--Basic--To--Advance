# Classes in JavaScript

## What is a Class?
- A **class** is one of the features introduced in the **ES6** version of JavaScript.
- You can think of a class as a **blueprint** for creating objects. 
- It is like a sketch or prototype of a house. The blueprint contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on this description, you can build the house.

## Why Use Classes?
- Since many houses can be made from the same blueprint, you can create **many objects** from a single class.
- A class defines the structure and behavior (properties and methods) that the created objects will have.

## Example Analogy
Imagine a class as a **house blueprint**:
- The blueprint describes the design of the house (e.g., number of floors, doors, windows).
- Using this blueprint, you can build multiple houses (objects).

In JavaScript:
- A class serves as the blueprint.
- Objects are the actual "houses" created from the blueprint.

## Key Points
1. **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects.
2. **Object**: An instance created from the class.
3. **Reusability**: You can create multiple objects from the same class, just like building many houses from one blueprint.
