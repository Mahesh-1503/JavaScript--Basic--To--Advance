## Understanding JavaScript Prototypal Inheritance
## JavaScript is a prototype-based language, which means that objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. This is known as prototypal inheritance . Unlike classical inheritance (used in languages like Java or C++), where classes inherit from other classes, JavaScript uses prototypes to achieve inheritance.

## In JavaScript, every object has an internal property called [[Prototype]] (often accessible via the __proto__ property). This [[Prototype]] points to another object, which serves as the prototype for the current object. When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript will first look for it on the object itself. If it doesn't find it, it will look up the prototype chain until it either finds the property/method or reaches the end of the chain (where it returns undefined).

## Key Concepts:
## Prototype Chain:
## The chain of objects linked together through their [[Prototype]] property is called the prototype chain .
## If a property or method is not found on the current object, JavaScript looks for it in the object's prototype, then the prototype's prototype, and so on, until it either finds the property or reaches the end of the chain (null).
## Constructor Functions and prototype:
## When you create objects using constructor functions, each instance of the object inherits properties and methods from the constructor's prototype object.
## The prototype property of a constructor function is an object that contains properties and methods that will be inherited by all instances created using that constructor.
## Object.create():
## You can also create objects with a specific prototype using Object.create(proto), which creates a new object with the specified prototype.
## __proto__ vs prototype:
## __proto__ is the actual prototype of an object (the object it inherits from).
## prototype is a property of constructor functions that defines the prototype for instances created by that constructor.
