<!-- Basic Prototypal Inheritance -->

<script>
    // Create a parent object
    const animal = {
        type: 'unknown',
        speak() {
            console.log(`The ${this.type} makes a sound.`);
        }
    };

    // Create a child object that inherits from the parent
    const dog = Object.create(animal); // dog's prototype is set to `animal`
    dog.type = 'dog'; // Override the `type` property

    dog.speak(); // Output: "The dog makes a sound."
</script>

<!-- Explanation:
We create an object animal with a type property and a speak method.
Using Object.create(animal), we create a new object dog whose prototype is animal.
When we call dog.speak(), JavaScript first looks for the speak method on the dog object. 
Since it doesn't find it there, it looks up the prototype chain and finds it in the animal object. -->
