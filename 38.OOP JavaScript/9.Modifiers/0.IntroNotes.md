# Modifiers

**Class modifiers**, also known as **access modifiers** or **visibility modifiers**, are keywords in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages that define the visibility or accessibility of class members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from other parts of the program. They control the level of encapsulation and help enforce encapsulation principles by restricting access to certain class members.

### Common Access Modifiers:

- **Public**: The member is accessible from any other part of the program.
- **Private**: The member is only accessible within the same class.
- **Protected**: The member is accessible within the same class, its subclasses, and sometimes within the same package.
- **Default (Package-Private)**: The member is accessible only within the same package (if no modifier is specified).

These modifiers play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the code by controlling how different parts of the program interact with each other.
